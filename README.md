## üß† P2V-MEM IP ‚Äì Basic Tier  
_Reduced feature set for open source version_

### ‚úÖ Supported Features
- Intuitive specification of total virtual memory dimensions  
- Automatic calculation of memory rows and banks  
- Supports both flip-flop (FF) and library SRAM implementations  
- Flexible memory port configuration:  
  - Single or dual ports  
  - Each port independently configurable as:  
    - Read-only  
    - Write-only  
    - Read/Write  
- Clocking options: independent or shared per port  
- Bit-select and byte-select support  
- Attribute extraction from target library SRAM  
- Optional output sampling for post-processing  
- Built-in testbench tasks for quick verification:  
  - `read`  
  - `write`  
  - `load file`
