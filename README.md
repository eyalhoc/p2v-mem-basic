
This is the Basic Tier of the P2V-MEM IP. 
 
Features:<br>
	* simply specify dimentions of virtual memory (total memory) <br>
	* automatic calculation of row and bank numbers <br>
	* ff or library sram implemetation <br>
	* single or dual ports, each can be read, write or read and write <br>
	* same or different clocks for each port <br>
	* bit select and byte select <br>
	* attribute extraction from library sram <br>
	* optional sampling of output <br>
	* testbench tasks: read, write and load file <br>
 <br>
Unsupported features (contact Eyal Hochberg: eyalhoc@gmail.com for inquires) <br>
	* support tiling different srams for exact size matching <br>
	* hamming code error correction (ECC), two bit detection one bit correction <br>
	* supports optional sampling both input and output of ecc decoder <br>
	* ECC byte access by performing read-modify-write <br>
	* AXI bus interface <br>
	* multiple interfaces with simulatanious access to different parts of memory (different sram rows) <br>
 <br>
